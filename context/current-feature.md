### Mock Data for Dashboard UI — 2026-08-03

Added `src/lib/mock-data.ts` as the single source of truth for dashboard mock data until Git-backed storage is implemented. Exports `itemTypes` (7), `collections` (6) and `items` (12), matching the counts in `context/screenshots/dashboard-ui-main.png` (5 favorites, 3 pinned). Items carry frontmatter-mappable fields (`id`, `title`, `type`, `tags`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`) plus `content`, `language`, `url` and `fileName` where the type needs them; items reference collections by `collectionId`. Domain types are exported from the same file since the spec limited the change to one file. No auth data, database, persistence, helpers or Git logic. Spec: `context/features/mock-data-spec.md`.
