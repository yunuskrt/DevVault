### Mock Data for Dashboard UI — 2026-08-03

Added `src/lib/mock-data.ts` as the single source of truth for dashboard mock data until Git-backed storage is implemented. Exports `itemTypes` (7), `collections` (6) and `items` (12), matching the counts in `context/screenshots/dashboard-ui-main.png` (5 favorites, 3 pinned). Items carry frontmatter-mappable fields (`id`, `title`, `type`, `tags`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`) plus `content`, `language`, `url` and `fileName` where the type needs them; items reference collections by `collectionId`. Domain types are exported from the same file since the spec limited the change to one file. No auth data, database, persistence, helpers or Git logic. Spec: `context/features/mock-data-spec.md`.

### Dashboard UI Phase 1 — 2026-08-03

Built the dashboard shell at `/`. Initialized shadcn/ui (`components.json`, `src/lib/utils.ts`) and installed `button`, `input`, `separator` and `scroll-area`. Theme tokens live in `src/app/globals.css` via `@theme inline` plus `:root`/`.dark` custom properties; primary is a green accent matching the reference screenshot. `src/app/layout.tsx` sets `className="dark"` on `<html>` so dark mode is the default while light tokens stay available.

`src/app/page.tsx` composes the shell: `TopBar` above a flex row of `Sidebar` and `MainArea`, with `h-dvh` on the outer wrapper so only the main region scrolls. `TopBar` holds a read-only search `Input` with a `lucide-react` search icon and a display-only "New Item" `Button` — no behavior this phase. `Sidebar` and `MainArea` are placeholders with `h2` headings only; the sidebar is `hidden md:block` since the mobile drawer is phase 2 scope.

Followed the spec's top-bar placement over the screenshot's (search in the main column, "New Item" in the sidebar); phase 2 may move them. `npm run build` passes and the rendered page was verified against the dev server.

Review fixes applied before merge: the search input got an `aria-label` (a placeholder is not an accessible name), and `shadcn` (a CLI) plus `tw-animate-css` moved to `devDependencies` to match how `tailwindcss` is declared — the `@import "shadcn/tailwind.css"` in `globals.css` still resolves at build time.

Carried into phase 2: `separator` and `scroll-area` are installed but unused, awaiting the sidebar. The shell currently lives in `page.tsx`; once `/items/[type]` exists it needs to move to a `layout.tsx` so both routes share it. `Sidebar` is `hidden md:block`, so mobile has no navigation until the drawer lands. CLAUDE.md documents `npm run lint`, but no such script exists in `package.json`.
